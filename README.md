Resolve The Requests:

- If the keyword is more than one word, then display in two lines. These two lines should have minimum difference in length. For example: "nguyễn nhật ánh" should be "nguyễn\nnhật ánh", not "nguyễn nhật\nánh". Because difference in length of "nguyễn" and "nhật ánh" is less than difference in length of "nguyễn nhật" and "ánh".

- Keywords must be fetched from the link.
